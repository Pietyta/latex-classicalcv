The original templates utilizes XeLaTeX engine and Fontin font. \r\nMore informations can be found here\r\n- http://fr.scribd.com/doc/16335667/Writing-your-Professional-CV-with-LaTeX\r\n- http://www.latextemplates.com/template/plasmati-graduate-cv\r\n- https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/professional-cv\r\n\r\nIn my version, Personal data have moved on top of the page just before the professional title.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have also created little Latex macros to make easier and cleaner Latex source code\r\n\r\n```TeX\r\n\\user{firstname}{LASTNAME}\r\n\\linkedin{{link}{Link Description}}\r\n\\address{12, Dummy Road, 000000, Dummy Country}\r\n\\infos{Dummy infos (birthday, etc...)}\r\n\\smartphone{+687 000 000}\r\n\\email{mail@dummy-mail.com}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother macro has been set to perform conditional include. You have to put \\demotrue or \\demofalse once in your file to use \\conditionalinput macro\r\n\r\n```TeX\r\n%These two lines will include section_references_demo\r\n\\demotrue\r\n\\conditionalinput{section_references_demo}{references}\r\n\r\n%These two lines will include references\r\n\\demotrue\r\n\\conditionalinput{section_references_demo}{references}\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
